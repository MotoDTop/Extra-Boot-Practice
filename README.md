# <Let's Play Rock Paper Scissors>

## Description

I made this to expand on the knowledge I had gained from my prework studies for an upcomming bootcamp on coding. 

I wanted to see if I could use the code provided by the bootcamp and make something that allowed me to experiment with the code.

## Installation

This is designed to use the console, while the code randomly selects one of the three choices, rock, paper or scissors. Playing on the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors.
